  <h1 class="title"> Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    "Tobacco use has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, and, despite efforts
    to reverse smoking trends, the problem only seems to be getting bigger each
    year.
  </p>
  <p>
    While smokers know full well that cigarettes offer nothing but harm to their
    health, they will ignore every warning until something suddenly clicks and
    tells them that it's time to stop. So, instead of just looking at the
    benefits of quitting, here are some cold, hard facts that may put the scale
    of the problem into perspective.
  </p>
  <h3 class="bullets"> The Tobacco Industry Today</h3>
  <p>
    Around 6.5 trillion cigarettes are sold around the world each year, which
    translates to roughly 18 billion cigarettes per day. It is a lucrative
    industry and one that makes its fortunes largely off the back of the poorest
    people in the world, both in terms of supply and demand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of the estimated one billion smokers in the world, 80 percent live in
    low- and middle-income countries. Of the estimated 33 million tobacco farm
    workers in the industry, a substantial proportion live in the poorest
    communities and regions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some of these countries, even children are forced to work in the fields
    to help pay the family bills. This places them and the other farm workers at
    risk of green tobacco sickness, an illness caused by absorption of nicotine
    through the skin from the handling of wet leaves.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the United States has significantly decreased its share of tobacco
    farming from over 180,000 farms in the 1980s to just over 10,000 today, it
    is still the fourth largest producer in the world. This despite the fact
    that smoking-related diseases cost the U.S. more than $300 billion per year.
  </p>
  <p>
    China, India, and Brazil are today the three largest tobacco-producing
    countries. Not surprisingly, it is within these many of these nations that
    smoking awareness is at its lowest.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A 2009 survey in China showed that only 38 percent of smokers knew
          that smoking could cause heart disease while only 27 percent knew that
          it could lead to a stroke.
        </li>
        <li>
          Similarly, more than 25 percent of the population of Bangladesh,
          India, the Netherlands, Russia, Thailand, and Vietnam were unaware of
          the association between smoking and cardiovascular diseases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, 17 percent of smokers in New Zealand, 14 percent in France,
          and 13 percent in the United States were unaware of the cardiovascular
          risks of smoking despite the fact that heart disease—and not lung
          cancer—is the number one killer of smokers.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 class="bullets"> Current Health Statistics</h3>
  <p>
      While smokers often will often assume that lung cancer and other
      smoking-related diseases are a "roll of the dice" beyond their control,
      consider these facts:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Tobacco today kills around half of all smokers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Globally, tobacco causes six million deaths per year. That's one death
        every five seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Of the total number of deaths, 600,000 are among non-smokers who had
        been exposed to secondhand smoke.
      </li>
      <li>
        By 2030, if the trend continues, the number of deaths will rise to
        eight million.
      </li>
      <li>
        Smoking is the direct cause of one of every five deaths in the U.S.
        That translates to roughly 480,000 deaths annually, 1,300
        smoking-related deaths per day, 54 deaths per hour, or almost one
        death per minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every cigarette you smoke cuts five to 11 minutes from your life.
        Over a lifetime, that can reduce your life expectancy by as much as
        12 years.
      </li>
      <li>
        Around 25 percent of all heart disease deaths and 75 percent of lung
        disease deaths are directly attributed to smoking irrespective of any
        other cause<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/global-smoking-statistics-for-2002-2824393"> (Quoted from Verywell mind, 2018)</a>".
